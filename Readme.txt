============= Bash Utils =============
some pieces of scripts that might work
======================================

* trackpad-pinch-fix

  In macOS "Sierra" and "High Sierra",
  Sometimes the pinch feature of the 
  trackpad doesn't work normally. Swi-
  tching the preference quickly seems 
  to be able to solve this problem.
  So that's basically what the script 
  do.

* dock-pop-up-instantly

  Makes the Dock pop up instantly when
  the mouse touches the bottom edge
  of the screen.

* auth-sudo-with-touch-id

  Enables you to authorize commands
  with Touch ID. Updating macOS will
  invalidate this patch.
