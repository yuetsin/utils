1
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,231
Command station, this is ST 321. Code
Clearance Blue.

2
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:35,465
We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:39,636
The security deflector shield will be
deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission.

4
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:43,287
Stand by...

5
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:47,458
You are clear to proceed.
-We're starting our approach.

6
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:17,494
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

7
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:21,666
Yes, sir.

8
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,378
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.
We're honored by your presence.

9
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,986
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander.

10
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,697
I'm here to put you back on scheudule.

11
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:07,242
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working
as fast as they can.

12
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:11,205
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

13
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:15,065
I tell you, this station will be operational
as planned.

14
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:19,236
The Emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

15
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:24,242
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

16
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:28,413
Then perhaps you can tell him when he
arrives.e

17
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:32,169
The Emperor's coming here?
-That is correct, Commander.

18
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,341
And he is most displeased with your
apparent lack of progress.

19
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:41,555
We shall double our efforts.
-I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

20
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:47,500
The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

21
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,210
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be, too.

22
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:11,382
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

23
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,972
Don't be so sure.

24
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:20,144
If I told you half the things I've heard about this
Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit.

25
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:37,768
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place?

26
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,547
I better knock, I suppose.

27
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:48,719
There doesn't seem to be anyone there.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

28
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:56,125
Goodness gracious me!

29
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:21,677
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo.

30
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:25,848
We'd better go..

31
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:36,486
Artoo, wait.
Oh, dear!

32
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:43,057
Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think
we should rush into all this.

33
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:48,584
Artoo, wait for me!

34
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,761
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and
get us out of here.

35
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:19,454
We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

36
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:26,755
... and a gift.
Gift, what gift?

37
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:46,884
He says that our instructions are to give it
only to Jabba himself.

38
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,901
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so
stubborn about these sort of things.

39
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:08,159
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.

40
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:45,705
Good morning.

41
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:53,215
The message, Artoo, the message.

42
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:05,520
Greetings, Exalted One.
Allow me to introduce myself.

43
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:09,797
I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and
friend to Captain Solo.

44
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:13,030
I know that you are
powerful, mighty Jabba,

45
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:16,993
and that your anger
with Solo must be equally powerful.

46
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:21,164
I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.

47
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,570
With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an
arrangement which will be mutually beneficial

48
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:32,846
and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.

49
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:37,746
As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift: these two droids.

50
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,981
What did he say?

51
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:45,047
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.

52
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:49,218
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the
wrong message.

53
00:09:57,668 --> 00:10:03,298
There will be no bargain.

54
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:05,699
We're doomed.

55
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:18,631
I will not give up my favorite decoration.
I like Captain Solo where he is.

56
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:23,428
Artoo, look! Captain Solo.
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

57
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,054
What could possibly have come over Master Luke.?

58
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:45,226
Is it something I did?
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work.

59
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,911
Ah, good. New acquisitions.

60
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,518
You are a protocol droid, are you not?

61
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:25,689
-I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
-Yes or no will do.

62
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:29,759
-Oh. Well, yes.
- How many languages do you speak?

63
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,931
I am fluent in over six million forms of
communication, and can readily...

64
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:37,789
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter
since our master got angry with...

65
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:41,960
...our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
-Disintegrated?

66
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:51,868
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful.

67
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:57,188
Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him
back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.

68
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:02,192
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!

69
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:09,493
You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon
learn some respect.

70
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:14,707
I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge.
And I think you'll fit in nicely.

71
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:46,976
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

72
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:51,252
Oh, no! Chewbacca!

73
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:56,572
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

74
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:07,002
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your
Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!

75
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:21,186
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will
gladly pay you the reward of twentyfive thousand.

76
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:29,529
Fifty thousand.
No less.

77
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:44,858
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?

78
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:52,057
Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.

79
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:59,565
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

80
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:15,314
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum.
Fearless and inventive.

81
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:30,645
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five.
And I do suggest you take it.

82
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:41,596
He agrees!

83
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:33,050
Just relax for a moment.
You're free of the carbonite.

84
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:40,872
-Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
-I can't see.

85
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:44,522
You eyesight will return in time.

86
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:48,694
-Where am I?
-Jabba's palace.

87
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,060
Who are you?

88
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,334
Someone who loves you.

89
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:03,505
Leia!

90
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:07,784
I gotta get you out of here.

91
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:12,268
What's that?

92
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:16,753
I know that laugh.

93
00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:26,761
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way
to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked.

94
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,536
It's not my fault.

95
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:40,741
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good
smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.

96
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:46,056
Look...

97
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:49,490
Take him away!

98
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:53,355
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing
away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!

99
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,728
Bring her to me.

100
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:06,914
We have powerful friends.
You're gonna regret this.

101
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,058
I'm sure.

102
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,746
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

103
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:38,723
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?

104
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,374
Wait. I can't see, pal.

105
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:46,545
What's goin' on?

106
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:51,034
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care
of himself, much less rescue anybody.

107
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,453
A...Jedi Knight?

108
00:21:56,454 --> 00:22:00,625
I--I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

109
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:08,242
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.

110
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:07,689
I must speak with Jabba.

111
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:16,867
You will take me to Jabba now!

112
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:23,016
You serve your master well.

113
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:27,188
And you will be rewarded.

114
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:38,139
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

115
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:44,296
...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.

116
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,554
I must be allowed to speak.

117
00:23:55,123 --> 00:24:03,570
You weak-minded fool!
He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

118
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:07,762
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me

119
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:18,242
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

120
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:22,464
Nevertheless, I'm taking
Captain Solo and his friends.

121
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:27,368
You can either profit by this...
or be destroyed!

122
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:31,539
It's your choice. But I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

123
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:34,458
Master Luke, you're standing on...

124
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:43,952
There will be no bargain, young Jedi.
I shall enjoy watching you die.

125
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:12,330
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.
They will all suffer for this outrage.

126
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:35,896
-Are you all right?
-Fine. Together again, huh?

127
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,569
Wouldn't miss it.

128
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,655
-How are we doing?
-The same as always.

129
00:28:39,656 --> 00:28:41,950
That bad, huh?

130
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,121
-Where's Leia?
-I'm here.

131
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:54,880
His High Exaltedness, the great
Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to
be terminated...

132
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:59,158
...immediately.
-Good, I hate long waits.

133
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:04,787
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea
and cast into the pit of Carkoon,

134
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,336
...the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

135
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:09,791
Doesn't sound so bad.

136
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:16,049
In his belly, you will find a new definition
of pain and suffering, as you are slowly
digested over a thousand years.

137
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:21,785
-On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
-You should have bargained, Jabba.

138
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:30,028
That's the last mistake you'll ever make

139
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:21,754
I think my eyes are getting better.

140
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:25,615
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

141
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:31,872
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know
-You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

142
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:36,355
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.
I've taken care of everything.

143
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:40,527
Oh... great!

144
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:55,650
Artoo! What are you doing here?

145
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,678
Well, I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

146
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:02,849
They're going to execute Master Luke and,
if we're not careful, us too!

147
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:08,586
I wish I had your confidence.

148
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:36,013
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His
Excellency hopes that you will die honorably.

149
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:43,313
But should any of you wish to beg for mercy,
the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.

150
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:52,076
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of worm-ridden filth

151
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:58,126
he'll get no such pleasure from us.
...Right?

152
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,961
Jabba! This is your last chance.

153
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:08,133
Free us or die.

154
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:11,473
Move him into position.

155
00:32:36,503 --> 00:32:39,110
Put him in.

156
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:26,874
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?

157
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,690
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?!

158
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,862
Where?

159
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:25,279
-Lando, grab it!
-Lower it!
-I'm trying!

160
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,520
Grab me, Chewie!
I'm slipping.

161
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:05,227
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!

162
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:17,012
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy.
Hold me, Chewie.

163
00:35:27,964 --> 00:35:29,630
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun.

164
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,386
- Don't move, Lando.
-No, wait! I thought you were blind!

165
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:37,558
-It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
-All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

166
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:44,752
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up,
Chewie, up!

167
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:48,713
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.

168
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:52,885
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo.
Oh! Ohhh! You beast!

169
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,589
Get the gun!

170
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:06,760
Point it at the deck!

171
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:13,539
Point it at the deck!

172
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,961
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't
possibly jump.... ahhhhhh!!!!

173
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:26,366
Come on!

174
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:35,858
-Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
-We're on our way.

175
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:18,097
-I'll meet you back at the fleet.
-Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now

176
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:19,452
I will.

177
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:22,790
Hey, Luke, thanks.
Thanks for comin' after me.

178
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:26,962
Now I owe you one.

179
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:34,366
That's right, Artoo.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

180
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:43,543
I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.

181
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:38,714
Rise, my friend.

182
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:46,641
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

183
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:50,812
You have done well, Lord Vader.
And now I sense you wish to...

184
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:55,089
...continue your search for young Skywalker.

185
00:38:57,906 --> 00:39:00,304
Yes, my Master.

186
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:04,476
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out.

187
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:09,795
And when he does, you must
bring him before me.

188
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:12,923
He has grown strong.

189
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:17,095
Only together can we turn him to
the dark side of the Force.

190
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:22,311
As you wish.

191
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:26,482
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

192
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:55,474
Hmm. That face you make.

193
00:39:55,475 --> 00:39:59,646
-Look I so old to young eyes?
-No... of course not.

194
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,487
I do,

195
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,449
yes, I do!

196
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,621
Sick have I become.
Old and weak.

197
00:40:19,255 --> 00:40:23,426
When nine hundred years old you reach,
look as good you will not. Hmm?

198
00:40:30,518 --> 00:40:34,272
Soon will I rest.

199
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:37,192
Yes, forever sleep.

200
00:40:37,192 --> 00:40:39,695
Earned it, I have.

201
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:43,554
Master Yoda, you can't die.

202
00:40:43,555 --> 00:40:47,726
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong!

203
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:54,817
Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall.

204
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:03,892
That is the way of things

205
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:08,063
the way of the Force.

206
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:12,444
But I need your help. I've come back to
complete the training.

207
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:17,032
No more training do you require.
Already know you that which you need.

208
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:26,209
Then I am a Jedi?

209
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:34,762
Not yet. One thing remains:

210
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:39,873
Vader. You must confront Vader.

211
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:44,774
Then, only then, a Jedi
will you be.

212
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:51,032
And confront him you will.

213
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:57,603
Master Yoda...

214
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:02,608
is Darth Vader my father?

215
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:08,448
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.

216
00:42:11,683 --> 00:42:15,854
Yoda, I must know.

217
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:22,320
Your father he is.

218
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,871
-Told you, did he?
-Yes.

219
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:38,277
Unexpected this is

220
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,614
and unfortunate...

221
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:45,786
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

222
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:52,357
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him...

223
00:42:52,462 --> 00:42:56,007
that incomplete was your training.

224
00:42:56,007 --> 00:43:00,178
Not ready for the burden were you.

225
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:04,455
I'm sorry.

226
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:08,626
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force

227
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:19,160
But beware. Anger, fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.

228
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:28,129
Once you start down the dark path,

229
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:32,300
forever will it dominate your destiny.

230
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,841
Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,

231
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:53,577
or suffer your father's fate, you will.

232
00:43:57,331 --> 00:44:01,502
Luke, when gone am I,
the last of the Jedi will you be.

233
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:11,514
The Force runs strong in your family.

234
00:44:11,617 --> 00:44:18,503
Pass on what you have learned.

235
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:45,515
Luke... There is... another...
Sky...Sky...walker.

236
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:45,588
I can't do it, Artoo.

237
00:45:47,465 --> 00:45:49,656
I can't go on alone.

238
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:53,827
-Yoda will always be with you.
-Obi-Wan!

239
00:46:02,587 --> 00:46:06,758
Why didn't you tell me?
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

240
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:12,287
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force.

241
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:18,023
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker,
and became Darth Vader.

242
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:22,195
When that happened, the good man
who was your father was destroyed.

243
00:46:23,863 --> 00:46:26,262
So what I have told you was true....

244
00:46:26,263 --> 00:46:28,556
...from a certain point of view.

245
00:46:28,556 --> 00:46:31,372
A certain point of view!

246
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:34,606
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to

247
00:46:34,606 --> 00:46:38,463
depend greatly on our own point of view.

248
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:42,114
Anakin was a good friend.

249
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:46,182
When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot.

250
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:49,833
But I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

251
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:54,004
I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.

252
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:58,279
I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.

253
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,158
I was wrong.

254
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:04,329
-There's still good in him.
-He is more machine now than man.

255
00:47:04,537 --> 00:47:08,708
Twisted and evil.

256
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:12,880
-I can't do it, Ben.
-You cannot escape your destiny.

257
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:16,740
You must face Darth Vader again!

258
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:20,912
I can't kill my own father.

259
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:26,752
Then the Emperor has already won.

260
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:30,507
You were our only hope.

261
00:47:30,507 --> 00:47:34,470
Yoda spoke of another.

262
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:38,120
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

263
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,936
But I have no sister.

264
00:47:40,937 --> 00:47:45,108
To protect you both from the Emperor, you were
hidden from your father when you were born.

265
00:47:46,986 --> 00:47:50,114
The Emperor knew, as I did,

266
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:54,285
if Anakin were to have any offspring,
they would be a threat to him.

267
00:47:55,851 --> 00:48:00,022
That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

268
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:05,548
Leia! Leia's my sister.

269
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,096
Your insight serves you well.

270
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:12,537
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

271
00:48:12,538 --> 00:48:16,709
They do you credit. But they could be
made to serve the Emperor.

272
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,677
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

273
00:48:42,677 --> 00:48:46,641
Oh, well, someone must have told them about
my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

274
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:49,039
Well, don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

275
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,480
I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody
to lead this crazy attack.

276
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:55,088
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

277
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:59,259
Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy.
You're the respectable one, remember?

278
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:11,357
The Emperor has made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

279
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,529
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints
the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station.

280
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:21,892
We also know that the weapon systems
of this Death Star are not yet operational.

281
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:26,689
With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout
the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us,

282
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,297
it is relatively unprotected.

283
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:31,800
But most important of all:

284
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,928
We've learned that the Emperor
himself is personally overseeing

285
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:39,100
the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.

286
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:43,272
Many Bothans died to bring us this information.

287
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,652
Admiral Ackbar, please.

288
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:51,824
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest Moon of Endor.

289
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:57,768
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational,

290
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:02,357
the Death Star does have a
strong defense mechanism.

291
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:08,197
It is protected by an energy shield, which is
generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor.

292
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:18,732
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

293
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:24,155
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter,

294
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:29,892
while the fighters fly into the superstructure
and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

295
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:37,087
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
-Good luck.

296
00:50:39,486 --> 00:50:41,364
You're gonna need it.

297
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:43,971
General Madine.

298
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:47,724
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.

299
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:51,896
Disguised as a cargo ship,
and using a secret Imperial code,

300
00:50:52,001 --> 00:50:56,172
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

301
00:50:56,487 --> 00:51:00,137
-Sounds dangerous.
-I wonder who they found to pull that off.

302
00:51:00,137 --> 00:51:03,265
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?

303
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:07,437
Uh, my team's ready.
I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.

304
00:51:08,376 --> 00:51:12,547
Well, it's gonna be rough, pal.
I didn't want to speak for you.

305
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:17,031
-That's one.
-Uh, General... count me in.

306
00:51:17,345 --> 00:51:21,516
I'm with you, too!

307
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:27,774
-What is it?
-Ask me again sometime.

308
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:31,841
-Luke.
-Hi, Han... Chewie.

309
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:36,013
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.

310
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:55,411
Look. I want you to take her.
I mean it. Take her.

311
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:59,583
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

312
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:03,962
All right, old buddy. You know,
I know what she means to you.
I'll take good care of her.

313
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:09,594
She-she won't get a scratch.
All right?

314
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:13,870
Right.

315
00:52:17,939 --> 00:52:22,110
-I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
-Look, would you get going, you pirate.

316
00:52:25,031 --> 00:52:29,202
-Good luck.
-You, too.

317
00:52:37,025 --> 00:52:41,196
-You got her warmed?
-Yeah, she's comin' up.

318
00:52:41,197 --> 00:52:45,368
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees
in mind when they designed her, Chewie.

319
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,717
Hey, are you awake?
-Yeah, I just got a funny feeling.

320
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,681
Like I'm not gonna see her again.

321
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:06,226
Come on, General, let's move.

322
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:09,146
Right. Chewie, let's see what
this piece of junk can do.

323
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:13,317
-Ready, everybody?
-All set.

324
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:18,428
Here we go again.

325
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:31,569
All right, hang on.

326
00:53:44,606 --> 00:53:48,151
What is thy bidding, my Master?

327
00:53:48,152 --> 00:53:52,323
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.

328
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:58,581
There it will stay until called for.

329
00:54:00,877 --> 00:54:04,735
What of the reports of the
Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

330
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:08,907
It is of no concern.
Soon the Rebellion will be crushed

331
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,827
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

332
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:15,999
Your work here is finished, my friend.
Go out to the command ship and await my orders.

333
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:21,004
Yes, my Master.

334
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:38,422
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have
to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.

335
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:43,637
We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.

336
00:54:43,637 --> 00:54:47,808
Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

337
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,611
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code
for shield passage.

338
00:54:58,864 --> 00:55:03,035
-Transmission commencing.
-Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

339
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:08,354
It'll work. It'll work.

340
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,336
Vader's on that ship.

341
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:14,507
Now don't get jittery, Luke.
There are a lot of command ships.

342
00:55:15,134 --> 00:55:19,305
Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look
like you're trying to keep your distance.

343
00:55:20,244 --> 00:55:24,415
I don't know. Fly casual.

344
00:55:28,274 --> 00:55:32,445
-Where is that shuttle going?
-Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?

345
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:39,224
-Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.

346
00:55:39,538 --> 00:55:43,709
-Do they have a code clearance?
-It's an older code, sir, but it checks out.

347
00:55:45,065 --> 00:55:49,236
I was about to clear them.

348
00:55:51,844 --> 00:55:54,660
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

349
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:58,832
It's your imagination, kid.
Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

350
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,095
Shall I hold them?

351
00:56:10,095 --> 00:56:14,266
No. Leave them to me.
I will deal with them myself.

352
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:20,420
As you wish, my lord.
Carry on.

353
00:56:26,575 --> 00:56:30,746
Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will
commence immediately. Follow your present course.

354
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:38,254
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

355
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:14,445
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.

356
00:57:27,065 --> 00:57:30,506
-Shall we try and go around?
-It'll take time.

357
00:57:30,506 --> 00:57:34,677
This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

358
00:57:36,347 --> 00:57:39,058
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

359
00:57:39,058 --> 00:57:43,229
-Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
-Hey... it's me.

360
00:58:29,327 --> 00:58:33,498
-Over there! Two more of them!
-I see them. Wait, Leia!

361
00:58:37,984 --> 00:58:42,155
Hey, wait! Ahhh!

362
00:58:46,431 --> 00:58:50,602
Jam their comlink. Center switch!

363
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:04,264
Move closer!

364
00:59:04,265 --> 00:59:08,436
Get alongside that one!

365
00:59:47,442 --> 00:59:51,613
Keep on that one!
I'll take these two!

366
01:02:03,442 --> 01:02:07,613
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!

367
01:02:18,564 --> 01:02:21,900
-Luke! Where's Leia?
-What? She didn't come back?

368
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:25,656
-I thought she was with you.
-We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her.

369
01:02:25,656 --> 01:02:28,784
Take the squad ahead.
We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

370
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:32,329
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

371
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:36,189
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

372
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:40,361
And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

373
01:03:01,116 --> 01:03:05,287
Cut it out!

374
01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:23,747
I'm not gonna hurt you.

375
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:34,176
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

376
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:38,139
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

377
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,580
Well, maybe you can help me.

378
01:03:41,581 --> 01:03:44,919
Come on, sit down.

379
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:49,090
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

380
01:03:49,403 --> 01:03:53,574
All right. You want something to eat?

381
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:02,439
That's right.

382
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:08,175
Come on. Hmmm?

383
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:30,598
Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you.

384
01:04:36,544 --> 01:04:40,715
You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?

385
01:04:44,053 --> 01:04:48,224
What is it?

386
01:05:25,145 --> 01:05:29,316
Freeze! Come on, get up!

387
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:37,450
Go get your ride and take her back to base.
-Yes, sir.

388
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:45,481
What the...

389
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:04,462
Come on, let's get outta here.

390
01:06:43,677 --> 01:06:47,848
I told you to remain on the command ship.

391
01:06:48,266 --> 01:06:52,437
A small Rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

392
01:06:54,837 --> 01:06:57,965
Yes, I know.

393
01:06:57,966 --> 01:07:01,823
My son is with them.

394
01:07:01,824 --> 01:07:05,995
-Are you sure?
-I have felt him, my Master.

395
01:07:07,874 --> 01:07:11,941
Strange, that I have not.

396
01:07:11,941 --> 01:07:16,112
I wonder if your feelings on this
matter are clear, Lord Vader.

397
01:07:16,122 --> 01:07:20,596
They are clear, my Master.

398
01:07:20,597 --> 01:07:24,768
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon
and wait for him.

399
01:07:25,394 --> 01:07:29,565
He will come to me?

400
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,278
I have foreseen it.

401
01:07:32,279 --> 01:07:36,450
His compassion for you will be his undoing.

402
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:40,830
He will come to you and then
you will bring him before me.

403
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:45,836
As you wish.

404
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:07,946
Oh, Master Luke.

405
01:08:09,511 --> 01:08:12,535
There's two more wrecked speeders back there.

406
01:08:12,536 --> 01:08:15,769
And I found this.

407
01:08:15,769 --> 01:08:19,940
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

408
01:08:22,651 --> 01:08:26,822
I hope she's alright.

409
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:33,289
What, Chewie? What? Chewie!

410
01:08:48,413 --> 01:08:52,584
Hey, I don't get it.
Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.

411
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:57,067
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!

412
01:08:59,363 --> 01:09:03,534
Nice work. Great, Chewie!

413
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:06,768
Great! Always thinking with your stomach.

414
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,896
Will you take it easy?
Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.

415
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:14,068
-Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
-Yeah, sure.

416
01:09:20,534 --> 01:09:24,705
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
It's a very long dro-o-op!!

417
01:10:07,987 --> 01:10:12,158
Wha--?  Hey!
Point that thing someplace else.

418
01:10:16,435 --> 01:10:20,606
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

419
01:10:25,717 --> 01:10:29,888
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.

420
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:34,164
Oh, my head.

421
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:40,110
Oh, my goodness!

422
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,398
Do you understand anything they're saying?

423
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:15,570
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms of communication.

424
01:11:15,778 --> 01:11:19,949
-What are you telling them?
-"Hello", I think...

425
01:11:20,889 --> 01:11:24,330
I could be mistaken.
They're using a very primitive dialect.

426
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:28,502
But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

427
01:11:31,736 --> 01:11:35,906
Well, why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

428
01:11:36,638 --> 01:11:40,390
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

429
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:41,642
Proper?!

430
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:45,398
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

431
01:11:45,398 --> 01:11:49,569
Why, you--

432
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:58,538
My mistake.
He's an old friend of mine.

433
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:48,495
I have a really bad feeling about this.

434
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:10,501
What did he say?

435
01:13:10,502 --> 01:13:14,673
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo,
but it appears you are to be

436
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:18,946
the main course at a banquet in my honor.

437
01:13:33,758 --> 01:13:36,155
Your Royal Highness.

438
01:13:36,156 --> 01:13:40,327
But these are my friends.

439
01:13:41,477 --> 01:13:45,648
Threepio, tell them they must be set free.

440
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:07,028
Somehow, I got the feeling that
didn't help us very much.

441
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:12,242
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you
wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.

442
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:16,623
-But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --
-Just tell them.

443
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:36,855
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me.
Just...

444
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:50,382
Thanks, Threepio.

445
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:54,553
I...I never knew I had it in me.

446
01:16:23,756 --> 01:16:27,927
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.

447
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:18,927
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

448
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:35,406
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.

449
01:17:35,824 --> 01:17:39,995
Just what I always wanted.

450
01:17:49,067 --> 01:17:53,238
Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.

451
01:17:57,098 --> 01:18:00,332
He says the scouts are going to show us
the quickest way to the shield generator.

452
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:04,503
Good. How far is it?
Ask him.

453
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:08,258
We need some fresh supplies, too.

454
01:18:08,259 --> 01:18:10,968
And try and get our weapons back.

455
01:18:10,968 --> 01:18:15,139
And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

456
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:19,626
Luke, what's wrong?

457
01:18:21,504 --> 01:18:25,047
Leia... do you remember your mother?
Your real mother?

458
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:28,698
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

459
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:30,577
What do you remember?

460
01:18:30,578 --> 01:18:34,749
-Just...images, really. Feelings.
-Tell me.

461
01:18:36,835 --> 01:18:43,092
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.

462
01:18:44,864 --> 01:18:49,035
-Why are you asking me all this?
- I have no memory of my mother.

463
01:18:51,121 --> 01:18:54,771
I never knew her.

464
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:58,942
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

465
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:06,036
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

466
01:19:07,393 --> 01:19:11,564
-How do you know?
-I felt his presence.

467
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:15,839
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

468
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,716
That's why I have to go.

469
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:21,887
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

470
01:19:22,097 --> 01:19:26,268
-I have to face him.
-Why?

471
01:19:30,231 --> 01:19:34,402
He's my father.

472
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:40,138
-Your father?
-There's more.

473
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:43,789
It won't be easy for you to hear it,
but you must.

474
01:19:43,789 --> 01:19:46,084
If I don't make it back, you're the only
hope for the Alliance.

475
01:19:46,085 --> 01:19:52,342
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power
I--I don't understand and could never have.

476
01:19:52,448 --> 01:19:56,619
You're wrong, Leia.
You have that power too.

477
01:19:56,619 --> 01:20:00,790
In time you'll learn to use it as I have.

478
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:07,986
The Force is strong in my family.

479
01:20:07,986 --> 01:20:12,157
My father has it...I have it...and...

480
01:20:16,018 --> 01:20:20,189
...my sister has it.

481
01:20:24,673 --> 01:20:28,844
Yes. It's you Leia.

482
01:20:33,122 --> 01:20:37,293
I know.

483
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:41,881
Somehow...I've always known.

484
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,801
Then you know why I have to face him.

485
01:20:44,801 --> 01:20:48,972
No! Luke, run away, far away.

486
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:52,521
If he can feel your presence, then leave this place.

487
01:20:52,521 --> 01:20:56,171
-I wish I could go with you.
-No, you don't.

488
01:20:56,171 --> 01:20:59,508
You've always been strong.

489
01:20:59,508 --> 01:21:01,697
But, why must you confront him?

490
01:21:01,697 --> 01:21:05,868
Because...there is good in him.
I've felt it.

491
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:10,040
He won't turn me over to the Emperor.
I can turn him back to the good side.

492
01:21:12,336 --> 01:21:16,507
I have to try.

493
01:21:32,882 --> 01:21:36,323
Hey, what's goin' on?

494
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:40,495
Nothing.
I - just want to be alone for a little while.

495
01:21:41,017 --> 01:21:45,188
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?

496
01:21:51,446 --> 01:21:55,304
I...I can't tell you.

497
01:21:55,305 --> 01:21:59,476
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?

498
01:22:15,955 --> 01:22:20,126
I'm sorry.

499
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:25,341
Hold me.

500
01:23:16,548 --> 01:23:20,719
This is a Rebel that surrendered to us.
Although he denies it, I believe there may
be more of them,

501
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:25,412
and I request permission to conduct
a further search of the area.

502
01:23:25,412 --> 01:23:29,583
He was armed only with this.

503
01:23:29,691 --> 01:23:32,089
Good work, Commander.

504
01:23:32,089 --> 01:23:36,260
Leave us.
Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.

505
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:42,308
Yes, my Lord.

506
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:45,959
The Emperor has been expecting you.

507
01:23:45,959 --> 01:23:48,878
I know, father.

508
01:23:48,878 --> 01:23:52,113
So, you have accepted the truth.

509
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:55,867
I've accepted the truth that you were once
Anakin Skywalker, my father.

510
01:23:55,867 --> 01:23:59,829
That name no longer has any meaning for me.

511
01:23:59,829 --> 01:24:03,479
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

512
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:07,651
I know there is good in you.
The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully.

513
01:24:11,721 --> 01:24:14,952
That is why you couldn't destroy me.

514
01:24:14,952 --> 01:24:19,123
That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.

515
01:24:25,069 --> 01:24:29,240
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

516
01:24:31,954 --> 01:24:36,125
Your skills are complete.

517
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:43,738
Indeed, you are powerful,
as the Emperor has foreseen.

518
01:24:49,266 --> 01:24:53,124
Come with me.

519
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:57,296
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

520
01:24:57,297 --> 01:25:01,468
You don't know the power of the dark side.

521
01:25:02,093 --> 01:25:06,055
I must obey my master.

522
01:25:06,055 --> 01:25:10,226
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

523
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:15,026
If that is your destiny.
-Search your feelings, father.

524
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:20,032
You can't do this.
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

525
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:25,870
It is too late for me, son.

526
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:32,128
The Emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

527
01:25:32,965 --> 01:25:37,136
He is your master now.

528
01:25:39,951 --> 01:25:44,122
Then my father is truly dead.

529
01:26:25,946 --> 01:26:30,117
The main entrance to the control bunker's
on the far side of that landing platform.

530
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:34,497
-This isn't gonna be easy.
-Hey, don't worry.

531
01:26:34,498 --> 01:26:38,669
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

532
01:26:46,387 --> 01:26:50,558
-What's he saying?
-He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

533
01:27:10,374 --> 01:27:14,129
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

534
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:17,674
Proceed with the countdown.

535
01:27:17,675 --> 01:27:21,846
All groups assume attack coordinates.

536
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:27,372
Don't worry, my friends are down there.
They'll have that shield down on time...

537
01:27:31,129 --> 01:27:35,300
or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.

538
01:27:36,553 --> 01:27:39,264
All craft, prepare to jump to
hyperspace on my mark.

539
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:43,435
All right. Stand by.

540
01:28:00,747 --> 01:28:04,918
Back door, huh?
Good idea.

541
01:28:10,969 --> 01:28:15,140
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

542
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:22,336
Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.

543
01:28:22,336 --> 01:28:25,048
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

544
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:28,803
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

545
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,975
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone
and done something rather rash.

546
01:28:38,086 --> 01:28:42,257
There goes our surprise attack.

547
01:28:47,994 --> 01:28:52,165
Look! Over there! Stop him!

548
01:29:01,656 --> 01:29:04,887
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

549
01:29:04,887 --> 01:29:09,058
You stay here. We'll take care of this.

550
01:29:09,374 --> 01:29:13,545
I have decided that we shall stay here.

551
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:49,077
Welcome, young Skywalker.
I have been expecting you.

552
01:30:51,685 --> 01:30:55,856
You no longer need those.

553
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:03,157
Guards, leave us.

554
01:31:07,953 --> 01:31:11,812
I'm looking forward to completing your training.

555
01:31:11,813 --> 01:31:15,984
In time you will call me Master.

556
01:31:17,133 --> 01:31:21,304
You're gravely mistaken.
You won't convert me as you did my father.

557
01:31:22,348 --> 01:31:26,519
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

558
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,671
You will find that it is you who are mistaken...

559
01:31:33,924 --> 01:31:38,095
about a great many things.

560
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:44,040
His lightsaber.
-Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon.

561
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:48,420
Much like your father's.

562
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:52,592
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

563
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:56,970
So will it be with you.

564
01:31:56,971 --> 01:32:01,142
You're wrong.
Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

565
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:09,070
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.

566
01:32:10,427 --> 01:32:16,684
Yes...I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

567
01:32:18,351 --> 01:32:21,167
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

568
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:25,339
Your faith in your friends is yours.

569
01:32:26,801 --> 01:32:30,972
It is pointless to resist, my son.

570
01:32:34,414 --> 01:32:38,585
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

571
01:32:40,046 --> 01:32:44,217
Your friends up there on the
Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap.

572
01:32:45,365 --> 01:32:49,117
As is your Rebel fleet!

573
01:32:49,118 --> 01:32:55,375
It was I who allowed the Alliance to
know the location of the shield generator.

574
01:32:55,794 --> 01:32:59,965
It is quite safe from your pitiful little band.

575
01:33:00,488 --> 01:33:04,659
An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.

576
01:33:05,389 --> 01:33:15,818
Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be
quite operational when your friends arrive.

577
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:24,891
All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly!
Quickly, Chewie.

578
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:32,608
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.

579
01:33:33,652 --> 01:33:37,823
Charges!  Come on, come on!

580
01:33:38,345 --> 01:33:42,516
Oh, my! They'll be captured!

581
01:33:43,248 --> 01:33:47,419
Wa-wait! Wait, come back!

582
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:50,027
Artoo, stay with me.

583
01:33:50,027 --> 01:33:54,198
Freeze!

584
01:33:55,032 --> 01:33:59,203
You Rebel scum.

585
01:34:16,622 --> 01:34:18,186
All wings report in.

586
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,480
Red Leader standing by.

587
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,044
Gray Leader standing by.

588
01:34:22,045 --> 01:34:24,024
Green Leader standing by.

589
01:34:24,024 --> 01:34:28,195
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

590
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:34,141
May the Force be with us.

591
01:34:36,018 --> 01:34:40,189
We've got to be able to get some kind of a
reading on that shield, up or down.

592
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:44,780
Well, how could they be jamming us if
they don't know if we're coming.

593
01:34:46,136 --> 01:34:49,683
Break off the attack!
The shield is still up.

594
01:34:49,683 --> 01:34:51,872
I get no reading. Are you sure?

595
01:34:51,872 --> 01:34:56,043
Pull up! All craft pull up!

596
01:34:58,235 --> 01:35:02,406
Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.

597
01:35:04,284 --> 01:35:07,412
Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

598
01:35:07,412 --> 01:35:11,583
It's a trap!

599
01:35:12,314 --> 01:35:16,485
Fighters coming in.

600
01:35:17,633 --> 01:35:21,804
There's too many of them!

601
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:25,872
Accelerate to attack speed!
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

602
01:35:25,872 --> 01:35:30,043
Copy, Gold Leader.

603
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:34,528
Come, boy. See for yourself.

604
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:41,410
From here you will witness the final
destruction of the Alliance,

605
01:35:41,932 --> 01:35:46,103
and the end of your insignificant Rebellion.

606
01:35:51,528 --> 01:35:55,699
You want this, don't you?

607
01:35:57,055 --> 01:36:01,226
The hate is swelling in you now.

608
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:06,129
Take your Jedi weapon.
Use it.

609
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:10,301
I am unarmed. Strike me down with it.

610
01:36:10,301 --> 01:36:13,741
Give in to your anger.

611
01:36:13,742 --> 01:36:17,913
With each passing moment,
you make yourself more my servant.

612
01:36:24,171 --> 01:36:28,342
-No!
-It is unavoidable.

613
01:36:28,448 --> 01:36:31,889
It is your destiny.

614
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:36,061
You, like your father, are now mine!

615
01:36:57,335 --> 01:37:01,506
All right, move it!
I said move it! Go on!

616
01:37:07,974 --> 01:37:12,145
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?
Were you looking for me?

617
01:37:14,232 --> 01:37:18,403
Bring those two down here!

618
01:37:23,828 --> 01:37:27,895
Well, they're on their way.
Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?

619
01:37:27,895 --> 01:37:31,023
Freeze! Don't move!

620
01:37:31,024 --> 01:37:35,195
We surrender.

621
01:39:38,262 --> 01:39:41,806
The code's changed. We need Artoo!

622
01:39:41,807 --> 01:39:43,059
Here's the terminal.

623
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:47,231
Artoo, where are you?
We need you at the bunker right away.

624
01:39:49,107 --> 01:39:53,278
Going? What do you mean, you're going.

625
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,450
But--but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo!
Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

626
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:28,008
Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!

627
01:40:28,008 --> 01:40:32,179
-Red Three, Red Two, pull in!
-Got it!

628
01:40:34,059 --> 01:40:36,351
Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!

629
01:40:36,351 --> 01:40:40,522
Cut to the left! I'll take the leader!

630
01:40:46,366 --> 01:40:50,537
They're heading for the medical frigate.

631
01:41:03,468 --> 01:41:07,639
Only the fighters are attacking.
I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.

632
01:41:11,187 --> 01:41:14,837
We're in attack position now, sir.
-Hold here.

633
01:41:14,838 --> 01:41:17,966
-We're not going to attack?
-I have my orders from the Emperor himself.

634
01:41:17,966 --> 01:41:22,137
He has something special planned for them.
We only need to keep them from escaping.

635
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:27,561
As you can see, my young apprentice,

636
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:31,524
your friends have failed.

637
01:41:31,524 --> 01:41:38,824
Now witness the firepower of this fully
armed and operational battle station.

638
01:41:40,701 --> 01:41:44,872
Fire at will, Commander.

639
01:41:58,953 --> 01:42:02,187
That blast came from the Death Star!

640
01:42:02,187 --> 01:42:04,688
That thing's operational!

641
01:42:04,689 --> 01:42:06,253
Home One, this is Gold Leader.

642
01:42:06,253 --> 01:42:08,757
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

643
01:42:08,757 --> 01:42:11,364
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

644
01:42:11,365 --> 01:42:13,972
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

645
01:42:13,972 --> 01:42:17,413
Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.

646
01:42:17,414 --> 01:42:21,585
Han will have that shield down.
We've got to give him more time.

647
01:42:39,837 --> 01:42:44,008
We're coming!

648
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:51,098
Come on! Come on!

649
01:42:52,247 --> 01:42:56,418
Oh, Artoo, hurry!

650
01:42:59,652 --> 01:43:03,823
My goodness!

651
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:11,541
Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

652
01:43:11,646 --> 01:43:14,983
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

653
01:43:14,983 --> 01:43:19,154
I'll cover you.

654
01:43:57,744 --> 01:44:00,038
Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can

655
01:44:00,038 --> 01:44:03,166
and engage those Star Destroyers
at point-blank range.

656
01:44:03,167 --> 01:44:06,817
At that close range, we won't last
long against those Star Destroyers.

657
01:44:06,817 --> 01:44:09,424
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...

658
01:44:09,424 --> 01:44:13,595
and we might just take a few of them with us.

659
01:44:15,055 --> 01:44:19,226
She's gonna blow!

660
01:44:19,645 --> 01:44:23,816
I'm hit!

661
01:44:26,737 --> 01:44:30,908
Your fleet has lost.
And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive.

662
01:44:35,183 --> 01:44:39,354
There is no escape, my young apprentice.

663
01:44:42,693 --> 01:44:46,864
The Alliance will die...

664
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:51,141
as will your friends.

665
01:44:53,434 --> 01:44:57,605
Good. I can feel your anger.

666
01:45:00,944 --> 01:45:03,135
I am defenseless.

667
01:45:03,136 --> 01:45:07,307
Take your weapon!
Strike me down with all your hatred,

668
01:45:07,933 --> 01:45:12,104
and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

669
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:51,151
I think I got it.
I got it!

670
01:47:57,410 --> 01:47:59,182
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

671
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:00,641
-Let's see.
-It's not bad.

672
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:02,520
-Freeze!
-Oh, dear.

673
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:06,691
Don't move!

674
01:48:08,256 --> 01:48:11,591
-I love you.
-I know.

675
01:48:11,591 --> 01:48:15,762
Hands up!
Stand up!

676
01:48:24,734 --> 01:48:28,905
Stay back.

677
01:48:34,536 --> 01:48:37,041
Get down here!

678
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:39,335
No, wait....

679
01:48:39,335 --> 01:48:43,506
I got an idea.

680
01:48:51,329 --> 01:48:53,623
Good.

681
01:48:53,624 --> 01:48:57,168
Use your aggressive feelings, boy!

682
01:48:57,169 --> 01:49:01,340
Let the hate flow through you.

683
01:49:05,512 --> 01:49:09,683
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

684
01:49:13,022 --> 01:49:17,193
I will not fight you, father.

685
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:33,461
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

686
01:49:57,137 --> 01:50:01,308
Your thoughts betray you, father.
I feel the good in you...

687
01:50:01,519 --> 01:50:05,690
-the conflict.
-There is no conflict.

688
01:50:07,672 --> 01:50:11,843
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before,
and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.

689
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:16,221
You underestimate the power of the dark side.
If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.

690
01:50:32,285 --> 01:50:36,456
Good. Good.

691
01:50:43,757 --> 01:50:46,154
Watch out. Squad at .06.

692
01:50:46,155 --> 01:50:49,389
I'm on it, Gold Leader.

693
01:50:49,389 --> 01:50:53,560
Good shot, Red Two.

694
01:50:56,481 --> 01:51:00,652
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

695
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:07,953
It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing into the woods.

696
01:51:08,266 --> 01:51:11,394
We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.

697
01:51:11,395 --> 01:51:13,689
Send three squads to help.

698
01:51:13,689 --> 01:51:17,860
Open the back door.

699
01:51:30,063 --> 01:51:34,234
Throw me another charge.

700
01:51:48,628 --> 01:51:52,486
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

701
01:51:52,487 --> 01:51:56,658
I will not fight you.

702
01:51:58,327 --> 01:52:02,498
Give yourself to the dark side.

703
01:52:02,811 --> 01:52:06,982
It is the only way you can save your friends.

704
01:52:08,131 --> 01:52:12,302
Yes, your thoughts betray you.

705
01:52:12,302 --> 01:52:14,909
Your feelings for them are strong.

706
01:52:14,910 --> 01:52:19,081
Especially for... Sister!

707
01:52:21,793 --> 01:52:25,964
So...you have a twin sister.
Your feelings have now betrayed her, too.

708
01:52:30,136 --> 01:52:34,203
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me

709
01:52:34,204 --> 01:52:38,375
Now his failure is complete.

710
01:52:39,835 --> 01:52:43,694
If you will not turn to the dark side,

711
01:52:43,695 --> 01:52:47,866
then perhaps she will.

712
01:53:33,234 --> 01:53:37,405
Good!

713
01:53:39,387 --> 01:53:43,558
Your hate has made you powerful.

714
01:53:43,765 --> 01:53:47,936
Now, fulfill your destiny

715
01:53:48,459 --> 01:53:52,630
and take your father's place at my side!

716
01:54:07,546 --> 01:54:11,717
Never!

717
01:54:11,822 --> 01:54:15,993
I'll never turn to the dark side.

718
01:54:17,349 --> 01:54:19,956
You've failed, Your Highness.

719
01:54:19,956 --> 01:54:24,127
I am a Jedi,
like my father before me.

720
01:54:31,638 --> 01:54:35,390
So be it...Jedi.

721
01:54:35,391 --> 01:54:39,562
Move! Move!

722
01:54:49,889 --> 01:54:53,956
The shield is down!
Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.

723
01:54:53,957 --> 01:54:55,521
We're on our way.

724
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:58,441
Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.

725
01:54:58,441 --> 01:55:02,612
Told you they'd do it!

726
01:55:07,098 --> 01:55:11,269
If you will not be turned,
you will be destroyed.

727
01:55:19,925 --> 01:55:22,637
Young fool...

728
01:55:22,637 --> 01:55:26,808
only now, at the end, do you understand.

729
01:55:40,783 --> 01:55:44,954
Your feeble skills are no match for
the power of the dark side.

730
01:55:50,588 --> 01:55:54,759
You have paid the price for your lack of vision.

731
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:03,624
Father, please. Help me.

732
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:21,041
Now, young Skywalker...

733
01:56:21,042 --> 01:56:25,213
you will die.

734
01:57:46,041 --> 01:57:50,212
I'm going in.

735
01:57:50,317 --> 01:57:54,488
Here goes nothing.

736
01:57:58,972 --> 01:58:03,143
Now lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

737
01:58:05,126 --> 01:58:09,297
Form up. And stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

738
01:58:24,314 --> 01:58:28,485
Split up and head back to the surface.
See if you can get a few of those
TIE fighters to follow you.

739
01:58:29,217 --> 01:58:33,388
Copy, Gold Leader.

740
01:58:40,689 --> 01:58:44,860
That was too close.

741
01:58:46,322 --> 01:58:50,493
We've got to give those fighters more time.
Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.

742
01:58:57,376 --> 01:58:59,880
Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

743
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:04,051
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

744
01:59:05,304 --> 01:59:09,058
Intensify forward firepower!

745
01:59:09,058 --> 01:59:13,229
It's too late!

746
01:59:55,364 --> 01:59:59,535
Luke, help me take this mask off.

747
01:59:59,536 --> 02:00:02,037
But you'll die.

748
02:00:02,038 --> 02:00:06,209
Nothing can stop that now.

749
02:00:06,837 --> 02:00:13,094
Just for once...
let me look on you with my own eyes.

750
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:54,915
Now...go, my son. Leave me.

751
02:00:59,399 --> 02:01:03,570
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here.
I've got to save you.

752
02:01:05,032 --> 02:01:09,203
You already have, Luke.

753
02:01:10,038 --> 02:01:14,209
You were right about me.

754
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:22,031
Tell your sister...you were right.

755
02:01:28,913 --> 02:01:33,084
Father...

756
02:01:34,443 --> 02:01:38,614
I won't leave you.

757
02:02:01,244 --> 02:02:05,209
There it is!

758
02:02:05,209 --> 02:02:07,816
All right, Wedge.
Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

759
02:02:07,817 --> 02:02:11,988
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

760
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:34,305
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

761
02:03:20,717 --> 02:03:24,888
They did it!

762
02:03:30,834 --> 02:03:34,796
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

763
02:03:34,796 --> 02:03:38,967
He wasn't.
I can feel it.

764
02:03:43,349 --> 02:03:47,520
You love him,

765
02:03:48,354 --> 02:03:50,128
don't you?

766
02:03:50,128 --> 02:03:54,299
Yes
-I understand, fine.

767
02:03:56,595 --> 02:04:00,766
When he comes back, I won't get in the way.

768
02:04:04,625 --> 02:04:08,796
No, it's not like that at all!

769
02:04:09,735 --> 02:04:13,906
He's my brother.
