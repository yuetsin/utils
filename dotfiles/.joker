(Arthur, does it help to have someone to talk to?)(My mother always tells me...)(...to smile and put on a happy face.)(She told me I had a purpose.)(To bring laughter and joy to the world.)(Hey! Hey! Stop them!)

(Is it just me...)
(...or is it getting crazier out there?)

Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky

(But now I realize...)
(...it’s a comedy.)

If you just smile
